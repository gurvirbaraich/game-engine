# Pixel2D
Pixel2D is a 2D game engine built in TypeScript. It provides an easy-to-use and flexible platform for game developers to create 2D games quickly and efficiently. It can run both as a desktop application and in the browser.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/gurvirbaraich/game-engine.git
    $ cd game-engine
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```
3. Build the project: 
    ```bash
    $ yarn build
    ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   $ yarn serve
   ```
   
   This will start a development server at **[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** and open the app in your default browser.

   To watch for changes in the source code and automatically rebuild, run:
   ```bash
   $ yarn build:watch
   ```
